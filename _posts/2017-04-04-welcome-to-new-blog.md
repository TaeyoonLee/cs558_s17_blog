Hi everyone! We've decided to move the course blog over to github. 
The process for posting reports will be the same as posting your class notes. 

We highly suggest submitting in markdown format. 

Markdown is simple and easy! If you've written a `Readme.md`, you've written markdown.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`. The file needs to be organized like so:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Your Title"
author: Your group's names
---

We decided to research..
```

For more information on markdown, please see [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for examples on how to style markdown.
